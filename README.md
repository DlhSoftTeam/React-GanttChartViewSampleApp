# React-GanttChartViewSampleApp
React sample for GanttChartView component from Gantt Chart Hyper Library

## Web server
Browsers will probably not be able to run the React based scripts referenced from `index.html` if you open it from your local computer (due to security restrictions). Instead, you should deploy the project files to a Web server (or host it locally, for example using Python: `python3 -m http.server`) and access `index.html` through HTTP (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`).
